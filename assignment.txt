In exercise 4 of set 4, I used five classes to complete the application. In my code, there is a Backend class, a LoginUI class, a RegisterUI class, ResetPasswordUI class, and an UnsubscribeUI class. The Backend class performs the functionality for all the buttons on the screen. To avoid code repetition and maintain organization, there is one class per notebook frame. There are four classes used for the user interface, LoginUI, RegisterUI, ResetPasswordUI, and UnsubscribeUI. These classes hold the code for entries, labels, and buttons the user sees.  LoginUI has attributes for the four notebook frames, and RegisterUI, ResetPasswordUI, and UnsubscribeUI reference LoginUI to gain access to the notebook frames.  Each UI class calls a specific function in Backend, where the button functionality is performed.
